SQL Injection (A03:2021)

Description:
Unsanitized user input is directly used in SQL queries, allowing attackers to manipulate the database.

Vulnerable Pattern:
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + user_input

Impact:
Attackers can read, modify, or delete sensitive data.

Fix:
Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks safely.
